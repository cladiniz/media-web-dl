##  A minimalist web interface for youtube-dl

*Early stages of development*

It aims to be a local (not intended to public access in any way) web interface to download, categorize, search and display media from all the websites accepted by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html).

It will have its own threaded processes to serve HTTP without any need for external servers, command line log output and input as well.
